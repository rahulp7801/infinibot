Last month, I went to Disney World with NAME . We traveled for NUM hours by NOUN . Finally, we arrived and it was very ADJ . There were ADJ people VING everywhere. There were also people dressed up in NOUN costumes. I wish it had been more ADJ , but we VERBPT anyway. We also went on a(n) ADJ ride called Magic NOUN . NAME nearly fell off a ride and had to be VERBPT . Later, we went to the hotel and VERBPT . Next year, I want to go to NOUN , where we can V3RB .

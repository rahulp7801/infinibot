I walk through the NOUN jungle. I take out my ADJ canteen. There is a ADJ parrot with a ADJ NOUN in his mouth right there in front of me in the ADJ trees! I gaze at his ADJ NOUN. A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream! A panther V3RB in front of my head! I V3RB his ADJ breath. I remember I have a packet of NOUN that makes go into a deep slumber! I V3RB it away from me in front of the NOUN . Yes he is eating it! I V3RB away through the ADJ jungle. I meet my parents at the tent. Phew! It has been an exciting day in the jungle.

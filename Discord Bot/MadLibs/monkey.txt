The day I saw the Monkey King V3RB was one of the most interesting days of the year. After he did that, the king played chess on his brothers NOUN and then combed his ADJ hair with a comb made out of old fish bones. Later that same day, I saw the Monkey King dance ADVERB in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats.

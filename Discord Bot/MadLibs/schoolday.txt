One very nice morning near the end of summer, my mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, "Wake up and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your first day of school and you can't be late." I groaned in my bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got dressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve NOUN with a collar on it, a red tie, dark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n) ADJ hat. In ten minutes I made lunch and ate my breakfast. NUM minutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I was at school. In school, I met two really ADJ kids. All of us became friends very fast. That day we had Science, and luckily my friends and I were at the same NOUN . My friends' names are NAME and NAME . In Math we weren't together, and that really bugged me. We learned what PN were, and when to use them. At snack and recess, we played a game together. It was extremely fun. At P.E., we were VING off of the ropes onto PN . I thought it was a very ADJ idea. In swimming class, we needed to swim extremely ADVERB , or else we would have to swim longer. Before I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all my belongings and put them into my backpack. In two minutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I shouted, "Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom," to my PN . Then I went into the NOUN . In a flash, I was back home. This day was an extremely exciting day!

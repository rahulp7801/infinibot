Today I went to the zoo. I saw a(n) ADJ NOUN jumping up and down in its tree. He VERBPT ADVERB through the large tunnel that led to its ADJ NOUN . I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray NOUN towering above my head. Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a ADJ scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to V3RB ADVERB to catch our bus. When I got home I V3RB my mom for a ADJ day at the zoo.

Maybe we can find a place to feel good and we can treat people with kindness. Find a place to feel good I got a good feeling I'm just takin' it all in. Floating up and dreaming, dropping into the deep end and if we're here long enough. They'll sing a song for us (ah-ah-ah-ah) and we'll belong, maybe we can find a place to feel good.
